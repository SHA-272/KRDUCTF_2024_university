Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells
All seem to say throw cares away
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer
To young and old, meek and the bold

Ding dong, ding dong, that is their song
With joyful ring, all caroling
One seems to hear words of good cheer
From everywhere, filling the air (From everywhere)

Oh, how they pound, raising the sound (Oh, how they pound)
O'er hill and dale, telling their tale (Telling their tale)
Gaily, they ring while people sing
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here

Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas)
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas)
On, on they send, on without end
Their joyful tone to every home (Ah, ah, ah)

Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong

Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells (Hark how the bells)
All seem to say, throw cares away (Seem to say)
(We will throw cares away)
